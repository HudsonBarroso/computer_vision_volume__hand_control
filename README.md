# Computer Vision Volume Hand Control
Computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers and systems to derive meaningful information from digital images

In this project we gonna use the Computer Vision tools to control the computer volume by gesture (hands)

The main libs are:
- 1. OpenCV - [link](https://opencv.org/)
- 2. MediaPipe - [link](https://mediapipe.dev/)
- 3. PyCaw - [link](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw)

------------

```
In order to use it, follow bellow steps:

- 1. git clone https://github.com/HudsonBarroso/computer_vision_volume__hand_control
- 2. create a virtual env
- 3. pip install -r requirements.txt
- 4. Run volume_hand_control.py

That is it!
```
